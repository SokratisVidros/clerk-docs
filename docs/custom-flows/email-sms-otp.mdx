# Build a custom email or SMS OTP authentication flow

<Callout type="danger">
  This guide is for users who want to build a *custom* user interface using the Clerk API. To authenticate users with one-time passwords using a *prebuilt* UI, you should use Clerk's [Account Portal pages](/docs/account-portal/overview) or [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview).
</Callout>

Clerk supports passwordless authentication, which lets users sign in and sign up without having to remember a password. Instead, users receive a one-time password (OTP), also known as a one-time code, via email or SMS, which they can use to authenticate themselves.

This guide will walk you through how to build a custom SMS OTP sign-up and sign-in flow. If you would like to use email OTP instead, the process is similar, and the differences will get pointed out along the way.

{/* TODO: Update these Steps when the Steps component can accept other headings. As of right now, Steps can only accept H3s. */}

<Steps>

### Enable SMS OTP

To use SMS OTP as an authentication strategy, you first need to enable it in the Clerk Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
2. Go to **User & Authentication > [Email, Phone, and Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username)** in the sidebar menu.
3. In the **Contact information** section, ensure only **Phone number** is toggled on. This will allow users to add phone numbers to their accounts. If you would like to use email OTP instead, you can enable the **Email address** option instead of the phone number option.
4. In the **Authentication strategies** section of this page, ensure only **SMS verification code** is enabled. Ensure **Password** is toggled off, as you are priotirizing passwordless, SMS OTP-only authentication in this guide. If you would like to use email OTP instead, you can enable the **Email verification code** strategy instead of the SMS strategy.

### Create the OTP sign-up flow

To sign up a user using an OTP, you need to:

1. Initiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's phone number.
2. Prepare the phone number verification, which sends a one-time code to the given address.
3. Attempt to complete the phone number verification by supplying the one-time code.
4. If the phone number verification is successful, complete the sign-up process by creating the user account and setting their session as active.

In the following example, the user is asked to provide their phone number. Once the user submits their phone number, a one-time code is sent to them. The user is then prompted to enter the code to complete the sign-up process. If the verification is successful, the user's session is set as active.

    For the sake of this guide, this example is written for Next.js App Router but it is supported by any React meta framework, such as Remix or Gatsby.

    ```js filename="app/sign-up/page.tsx"
    "use client";

    import * as React from "react";
    import { useSignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

    export default function Page() {
      const { isLoaded, signUp, setActive } = useSignUp();
      const [verifying, setVerifying] = React.useState(false);
      const [phone, setPhone] = React.useState("");
      const [code, setCode] = React.useState("");
      const router = useRouter();

      async function handleSubmit(e: React.FormEvent) {
        e.preventDefault();

        if (!isLoaded && !signUp) return null;

        try {
          // Start the Sign Up process using the phone number method
          await signUp.create({
            phoneNumber: phone,
          });

          // Start the verification - a SMS message will be sent to the
          // number with a one-time code
          await signUp.preparePhoneNumberVerification();

          // Set 'verifying' true to display second form and capture the OTP code
          setVerifying(true);
        } catch (err) {
          // See https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/error-handling for more on error handling
          console.error("Error:", JSON.stringify(err, null, 2));
        }
      }

      async function handleVerification(e: React.FormEvent) {
        e.preventDefault();

        if (!isLoaded && !signUp) return null;

        try {
          // Use the code provided by the user and attempt verification
          const completeSignUp = await signUp.attemptPhoneNumberVerification({
            code,
          });

          // This mainly for debuggin while developing.
          // Once your Instance is setup this should not be required.
          if (completeSignUp.status !== "complete") {
            console.error(JSON.stringify(completeSignUp, null, 2));
          }

          // If verification was completed, create a session for the user
          if (completeSignUp.status === "complete") {
            await setActive({ session: completeSignUp.createdSessionId });

            // redirect user
            router.push("/");
          }
        } catch (err) {
          // See https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/error-handling for more on error handling
          console.error("Error:", JSON.stringify(err, null, 2));
        }
      }

      if (verifying) {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={handleVerification}>
            <label htmlFor="code">Code</label>
            <input
              value={code}
              id="code"
              name="code"
              onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}
            />

{/* TODO (Roy): Use CodeBlockTabs and add example for NPM Module vs window.Clerk (Script) - see the /docs/components/user-button update I did in this PR */}

  ```js filename="SignUpPage.js"
  const { client } = window.Clerk;

  // Kick off the sign-up process,
  // passing the user's phone number.
  const signUp = await client.signUp.create({
      phoneNumber: "+11111111111",
  });

  // Prepare phone number verification. An SMS will
  // be sent to the user with a one-time verification
  // code.
  await signUp.preparePhoneNumberVerification();

  // Attempt to verify the user's phone number by providing
  // the one-time code they received.
  await signUp.attemptPhoneNumberVerification({
      code: "123456",
  });
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can also verify your users via their email address. There's two additional helper methods: [`prepareEmailAddressVerification`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/email-verification#prepare-email-address-verification) and [`attemptEmailAddressVerification`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/email-verification#attempt-email-address-verification). These helpers work the same way as their phone number counterparts do in the above example. You can find all available methods in the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object documentation.

### Create the OTP sign-in flow

To authenticate a user using a one-time code, you need to:

1. Initiate the sign-in process by collecting the user's authentication identifier.
2. Prepare the first factor verification.
3. Attempt to complete the first factor verification.
4. If the verification is successful, set the newly created session as active.

In the following example, the user is asked to provide their phone number. Once the user submits their phone number, a one-time code is sent to them. The user is then prompted to enter the code to complete the sign-in process. If the verification is successful, the user's session is set as active.

    ```js filename="SignInPage.js"
    const { client } = window.Clerk;
    // Kick off the sign-in process, passing the user's
    // authentication identifier. In this case it's their
    // phone number.
    const { supportedFirstFactors } = await client.signIn.create({

    // Find the phoneNumberId from all the available first factors for the current sign in
    const firstPhoneFactor = supportedFirstFactors.find(factor => {
      return factor.strategy === 'phone_code'
    });

    const { phoneNumberId } = firstPhoneFactor;

    // Prepare first factor verification, specifying
    // the phone code strategy.
    await signIn.prepareFirstFactor({
        strategy: "phone_code",
        phoneNumberId,
    });

    // Attempt to verify the user providing the
    // one-time code they received.

        strategy: "phone_code",
        code: "123456",
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can also achieve passwordless sign-ins with an email address. Simply pass the value `email_code` as the first factor strategy. Just make sure you've collected the user's email address first. You can find all available methods in the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object documentation.
