# Build a sign-in flow with Clerk Elements

In this guide you'll learn how to build a complete sign-in flow using Clerk Elements components.

<Steps>

### Add a sign-in route

Create a new route in your Next.js application. The route needs to be an [optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments) so the sign-in flow can handled nested paths. Add the following snippet to `/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`:

```tsx filename="/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx"
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

export default function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <SignIn.Root>
    </SignIn.Root>
  )
}
```

We've also added two imports, which we'll use as we build out the rest of the flow. `<SignIn.Root>` manages the sign-in state and handles connecting the components to Clerk's APIs.

### Add the start step

The Clerk authentication flows are made up of **steps**. Steps handle rendering the UI for each part of the flow. To allow users to create a sign-in attempt, the `start` step needs to be rendered. We'll use the `<SignIn.Step>` component to render this:

```tsx filename="/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx" {9-11}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

export default function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <SignIn.Root>
      <SignIn.Step name="start">
        <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>
      </SignIn.Step>
    </SignIn.Root>
  )
}
```

### Add form fields

Let's make it functional by adding fields. We'll use the Clerk Elements field components to render an `identifier` field, as well as the `<Provider>` component to render allow users to sign in with a social provider, like Google:

```tsx filename="/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx" {12-20}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

export default function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <SignIn.Root>
      <SignIn.Step name="start">
        <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>

        <Clerk.Provider name="google">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Provider>

        <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <Clerk.Action submit>Continue</Clerk.Action>
      </SignIn.Step>
    </SignIn.Root>
  )
}
```

`<Clerk.Field>` takes care of wiring up the input with the label element, and `<Clerk.FieldError>` will render any field-specific errors that get returned from the Clerk API. We've also introduced the `<Clerk.Action>` component. This component provides common actions that are used throughout the flows. In this case, we're using the `submit` action to render a submit button for the start form.

<Callout type="info">
If your Clerk instance supports signing in with Google and doesn't require MFA, you should be able to complete a sign in with the components we've rendered so far!
</Callout>

### Add verification

As you progress through a sign-in attempt, your users may be asked to **verify** a number of authentication factors. This is done in the `verifications` step. Depending on your instance configuration and the state of the sign in attempt, ceratin strategies will require diferrent fields. To support conditional rendering based on the strategy being verified, we will use the `<SignIn.Strategy>` component. We'll assume that your instance is configured to accept email codes and add the code necessary to accept them:

```tsx filename="/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx" {23-36}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignIn from '@clerk/elements/sign-in'

export default function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <SignIn.Root>
      <SignIn.Step name="start">
        <h1>Sign in to your account</h1>

        <Clerk.Provider name="google">Sign in with Google</Clerk.Provider>

        <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <Clerk.Action submit>Continue</Clerk.Action>
      </SignIn.Step>

      <SignIn.Step name="verifications">
        <SignIn.Strategy name="email_code">
          <h1>Check your email</h1>
          <p>We've sent a code to <SignIn.SafeIdentifier />.</p>

          <Clerk.Field name="code">
            <Clerk.Label>Email code</Clerk.Label>
            <Clerk.Input />
            <Clerk.FieldError />
          </Clerk.Field>

          <Clerk.Action submit>Continue</Clerk.Action>
        </SignIn.Strategy>
      </SignIn.Step>
    </SignIn.Root>
  )
}
```

In the verifications step, you will need to render a `<SignIn.Strategy>` component for each authentication strategy that your instance supports. This will also handle multi-factor authentication (MFA) if it is enabled for your instance. Check out the [Sign-in reference](/docs/elements/reference/sign-in#strategy) for a full list of possible authentication strategies.

Verification is the final step in the sign-in flow. When a user has verified all required factors, the sign-in attempt will be complete and they will be signed in.

### Customize and add styling

You might have noticed by now that none of components rendered so far come with their own styling. This is by design! With the exception of `<SignIn.Root>` and `<SignIn.Strategy>`, every component rendered so far can be styled. You can use the `className` prop to add custom classes to each component. Check out the [styling guide](/docs/elements/guides/styling) for a more in-depth guide on styling Clerk Elements components.

If you're looking to customize the UI even further, check out additional Clerk Elements components like [`<Loading>`](/docs/elements/reference/common#loading) and [`<FieldState>`](/docs/elements/reference/common#fieldstate).
